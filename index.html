      Brian Sales has more than 40 years of experience with the synthesis and characterization of
      unusual electronic and magnetic materials, particularly those involving rare earth elements.
      Dr. Sales has authored more than 400 papers and five book chapters, and he holds seven patents.
      His work has been cited more than 35,000 times, and his current h-index is 94 (81) Google
      Scholar (Web of Science).Ninety-one of his papers have been cited more than 100 times each,
      and Sales is the first author on 17 of those. The highly cited papers describe research on
      new thermoelectric materials, superconductivity,unusual magnetic phenomena, oscillatory
      catalytic reactions, batteries, and nuclear waste storage. Sales also has worked on the
      development and additive manufacturing of permanent magnets, developed techniques for measuring
      intermediate range order in phosphate glasses, and contributed to our understanding of the
      role of phosphate in biopoesis and the role of glass forming liquids in the cryopreservation
      of drosophila.
